## User stories

AS A health-conscious person (Who?)
I WANT TO access a description of classes (What?)
SO THAT I can decide which one helps me keep healthy (Why?)

AS A yoga instructor 
I WANT TO know access the yoga studio's location
SO THAT I can reach the studio before my session starts

AS A person worried about Anxiety
I WANT TO attend classes focusing on mental well-being or relaxation 
SO THAT I can overcome anxiety

## Typical mistakes when writing user stories 

1. Performing multiple actions in one user story (e.g. I want to visit a yoga studio and I want to sign up for a yearly membership and I want to take classes there and I want to know what kind of classes I can choose from. - these are 4 different user stoies)
2. Using technical terms that imply a certain way of implementation (e.g. button click, website browsing, submitting an online form). User stories are meant to be written without developer jargon. Reason: maybe the user's pain points or desires can be addressed offline.
3. Writing "As a User" without specifying what kind of user. Very common problem, many product managers mess this up. Select a well described user persona instead.
